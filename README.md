# Simulation
This project is for the work on my article "5G/B5G Service Classification Using Supervised Learning". It is based on simulation of a 5g network to improve its management through a more efficient classification of services. The link is: https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/11/4942
The abstract of the paper is:
The classification of services in 5G/B5G (Beyond 5G) networks has become important for
telecommunications service providers, who face the challenge of simultaneously offering a better
Quality of Service (QoS) in their networks and a better Quality of Experience (QoE) to users. Service
classification allows 5G service providers to accurately select the network slices for each service,
thereby improving the QoS of the network and the QoE perceived by users, and ensuring compliance
with the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Some projects have developed systems for classifying these
services based on the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that characterize the different services.
However, Key Quality Indicators (KQIs) are also significant in 5G networks, although these are
generally not considered. We propose a service classifier that uses a Machine Learning (ML) approach
based on Supervised Learning (SL) to improve classification and to support a better distribution of
resources and traffic over 5G/B5G based networks. We carry out simulations of our proposed scheme
using different SL algorithms, first with KPIs alone and then incorporating KQIs and show that the
latter achieves better prediction, with an accuracy of 97% and a Matthews correlation coefficient of
96.6% with a Random Forest classifier
